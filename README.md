# Virtual Mouse
In this project, I am going to create an AI based Mouse Controller. I will first detect the hand landmarks and then track and click based on these points. I will also apply smoothing techniques to make it more usable.
This is a college project for the subject Artificial Intelligence, which was made in a collaboration

The Problem statement was - To validate a hand-tracking module that can detect and track the movements of the hand in real-time and recognize specific hand gestures for controlling electronic devices or applications.
